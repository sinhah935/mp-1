                        <br>
                        <p class="proj-description"> This is a project I worked on with my club members in the BU F1Tenth group.
                            I have recently been appointed Vice President of the club, and my goal is to
                            aid new members into constructing their own car and participate in a
                            university tournament. <br> The car itself is controlled by an NVIDIA Nano Jetson, which is responsible for
                            the computations necessary for Autonomous driving. The Lidar in the front collects data regarding the
                            car's surroundings and feeds this into the Jetson. This data is then used to calculate the angle of the
                            servos to adjust turning radius. Speed is also another variable changed. This is all done leveraging PID
                            control.</p>

                            in CS454: Embedded Systems. Throughout this course, we learned how to
                            program on a dsPIC33. We learned how to program I/O devices, learned
                            UART Serial Communication, and eventually worked our way to learn
                            PID control to center a ball in the middle of a Touch Screen Board.</p>

                        <p class="proj-description"> This project was done during my participation
                            in CS350: Distributed Systems. The objective was to create an Image
                            Processing Server that took in an influx of image changing requests.
                            Our goal was to have multiple threads perform each request in a
                            First In First Out(FIFO) scheduler. To prevent race conditions and
                            multiple threads picking up the same request, I implemented
                            semaphores/mutexes to ensure one thread had write access to the
                            queue of requests at a time.</p>
